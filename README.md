# Uncommon HTML Bug: JavaScript Modification Before Element Rendering

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur in HTML when JavaScript code attempts to manipulate a DOM element before the browser has finished parsing and rendering that element. This often happens when the script is placed in the `<head>` section or early in the `<body>`, before the target element is encountered during the page load process.

## Bug Description
The primary issue lies in the timing of JavaScript execution.  If a script tries to access or modify a DOM element that hasn't yet been created by the browser, the script will fail, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

## How to Reproduce
1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe that the second paragraph is not appended in some browsers because the div is not found, resulting in silent failure or an error.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the JavaScript code that manipulates the DOM element is executed *after* the element has been fully parsed and rendered by the browser. The simplest solution is to place the script immediately before the closing `</body>` tag.
